# Project 1: Understanding Covid-19
In this project, I clean and analyze Covid-19 data from the CDC and Our World in Data using MySQL.

Contains three parts:

#### Data Cleaning: 
In MySQL, primarily consists of casting to fix data type issues.

#### Data Exploration: 
In MySQL, entirely consists of queries. Some more complicated queries in here than in 'data cleaning'.

#### Tableau Dashboard:

### Technologies: 
MySQL v8.0.26, Tableau v2021.4.4

# Project 2: German Energy Dependence
In this project, I attempt to understand German energy dependence on Russia with only one data set from Our World in Data

Contains three parts:

#### R code: 
In R, uses some tidyverse packages and ggplot2 to manipulate data into smaller data frames and create data visualizations.

#### Final report:
In Microsoft Word, I compile data visualizations and use calculations performed in R to form a final report on German energy dependence.

#### Tableau Dashboard:
